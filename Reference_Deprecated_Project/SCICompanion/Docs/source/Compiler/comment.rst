Comments are parts of your code that get ignored by the compiler. They allow you to remove parts of your code without deleting it, and place information in the script.

To create comment, use a semi-colon. The rest of the line will be ignored.

Examples of comments::

	; this is a full line comment
	(class MyClass of Object ; the rest of the line is ignored
