Properties are the member variables of classes and instances. They are 16-bit values declared in the properties block.

Properties are not limited to just integers, they can also be constant arithmetic expressions.
They can also be declared with strings, saids, local variable addresses. In latter cases, the 16-bit
address is used.

Example::

    (instance Glowing_Gem of InventoryItem 
        (properties 
			name "Glowing Gem"
            ; said will be a pointer to the said string
            said '~ gem [ AND glowing ] ~'
            ; description will be a pointer to the string
            description "You are still carrying the piece of orium"
            view 242
            someVarAddr @SomeVar
            signal (| fixPriOn ignAct) ; fixPriOn and ignAct are constant defines.
        )
    )
