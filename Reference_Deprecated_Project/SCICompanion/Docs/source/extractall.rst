You can extract all resources from a game (into :doc:`patch files <importexport>`) by using *Tools->Extract all resources*.

Choose the folder that the resources will be placed in. You can also set the following options:

- Generate bitmaps for pic resources and/or views
- Produce disassembled versions of all script resources
- Create text files for all message resources
- Create wav files for all digital audio
