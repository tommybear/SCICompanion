|scicomp| supports many levels of undo for nearly all of its editors. Undo and Redo use the standard windows shortcuts: CTRL-Z and CTRL-Y, or
they can be accessed from the **Edit** menu.

One exception is the :doc:`Message Editor <messages>` when used in games that support message audio. Because saving messages is closely tied to
the accompanying audio resources, undo functionality is not available.
