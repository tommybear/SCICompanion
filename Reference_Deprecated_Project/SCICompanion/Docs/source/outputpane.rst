 Output Pane
==============

The output pane in |scicomp| appears when you compile, do a project-wide search or debug a game. It consists of three tabs: **Compiler**, **Find Results** and **Debug Output**.

You can double-click on compile messages and find results to take you directly to the problem or search result.
