.. class:: MoveCycle

	Defined in MoveCycle.sc.

	
	A cycler that progresses through an explicit set of cels. See the init() method for more information about parameters.
	
	Example usage::
	
		; Defined at the top of the script:
		(local [celList 5] = [3 6 2 1 $8000]) // $8000 indicates the end of the cel list.
	
		; Then in code:
		(aStar setCycle: MoveCycle celList) // cycle through 3, 6, 2, 1 then stop.
