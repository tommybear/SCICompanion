Region (of :class:`Object`)
===========================

.. class:: Region

	Defined in Game.sc.

	
	Region serves as a base class for :class:`Rm`. It can also be used on its own, to contain
	common logic that applies to several rooms.
	
	To make a region part of a room, put the following code in the room's init() method::
	
		(self setRegions: MY_REGION)
		; Where MY_REGION would be a script number for a script that contains a public Rgn instance.


Subclasses: :class:`Room`.
