Classes
=======


The SCI 1.1 template game is built of around 120 classes to aid you when creating your game. These classes are called the class system. They are the base for all SCI games.

The class system is built so well, that to make a general Adventure game, you won't need to use many kernel functions. You simply use the class system, and it will take care of all the kernel calls you would need. It is mandatory for making adventure games in SCI.

To view the classes and procedures by their scripts, see :doc:`sci11_scripts`
