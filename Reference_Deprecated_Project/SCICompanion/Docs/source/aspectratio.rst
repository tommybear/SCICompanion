 Aspect Ratio
================

The original Sierra games were meant to be rendered with a 4:3 aspect ratio, despite their 320x200 resolution which
is a 16:10 aspect ratio with square pixels. So viewing these old games' resources in |scicomp|, things may look squished.

You can tell |scicomp| to use the original 4:3 aspect ratio in the **Tools->Preferences** dialog.
