Comments are parts of your code that get ignored by the compiler. They allow you to remove parts of your code without deleting it, and place information in the script.

To comment a line out, just place two forward slashes ("//") before it. The rest of the line will be ignored.

To comment out multiple lines, start the comment with "/\*", and end it with "\*/".

Examples of comments::

	/* This is
	* a BIG
	* Comment */
	// this is ignored
	(class MyClass of // Obj (this is ignored as well)
