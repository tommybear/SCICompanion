Prof-UIS Help (updated on  June 9 2011)

I. How to Use

1) Copy all the files from this folder to a (*** IMPORTANT! ***) local folder (e.g. "..\Prof-UIS\Help").

2) For HTML Help 1.4, just run ProfUIS292.chm (ProfUIS292.chi should be in the same folder) and use it. 

3) For HTML Help 2.0, if you have Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008 installed,
   run "register.bat" (if you run it before, run "unregister.bat" first).
   Run Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008 or Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008 Combined Collection.
   Make sure the "Filtered by:" combo box is set to "(unfiltered)".

II. What's New

Updated a number of existing classes.
