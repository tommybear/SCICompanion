# SCICompanion
SCI Companion - a complete IDE for Sierra SCI games (SCI0 to SCI1.1)

Official website:
http://scicompanion.com

General notes:
The bulk of the code is in SCICompanionLib\Src

SCICompanion is the .exe which is just a thin wrapper over SCICompanionLib

Fork of SCI Companion X, itself a fork of SCI Companion. Just some fixes from that fork to make it compile on the latest Visual Studio + the ability to actually get an export of the Visual, Priority and Control out at the same time as separate bitmaps when extracting all resources.
